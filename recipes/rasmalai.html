        <h4> Steps </h4>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.</li>
                    <li> Put the eggs and caster sugar in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer.
                         Whisk together gently using a stand mixer or electric whisk on a medium speed until thick and
                         luscious. The mixture should be at ribbon stage – where a solid line of the egg mixture will
                         fall from the whisk into the bowl and slowly disappear into the mixture. </li>
                    <li> Mix together the baking powder, salt and plain flour in a separate bowl.</li>
                    <li> Sift the flour mixture over the egg mixture in three batches, gently folding in the flour
                         between each addition. Gradually drizzle in the oil, folding as you pour. Make sure not to
                         overmix. </li>
                    <li> Pour the mixture into a 31x25cm/12x10in baking dish and bake for 30 minutes, or until a
                         skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool for 15 minutes in the dish. </li>
                    <li> Meanwhile, gently warm the milk, cream and condensed milk in a saucepan with the cardamom,
                         saffron, ground pistachios and crushed almonds until steaming. Take off the heat and leave
                         to cool slightly. Remove the cardamom pods. </li>
                    <li> Poke holes with a cocktail stick all over the cake and pour the slightly warm milk mixture
                         evenly over the top. Leave to cool at room temperature, then place in the fridge,
                         ideally overnight, to allow the flavours to relax and infuse. </li>
                    <li> To serve, top the cake with the whipped cream, crushed pistachios and flaked almonds.</li>
                </ol>
