        <h4> Steps </h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    To make the filling, cook the potatoes in a large saucepan of lightly salted boiling water for 8–10 minutes or until tender. 
                    Drain and set aside.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Heat the oil in a large frying pan and add the spices. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, then add the potatoes. 
                     Season with salt and stir-fry for 4–5 minutes until well coated. 
                     Remove from the heat and add the lemon juice and chopped coriander. Set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make the dosas, whisk the flours and baking powder together with 300ml/10fl oz water in a large jug to make a runny batter 
                    (it should be thinner than a pancake batter so add more water if needed). 
                    It should be quite runny because you need to spread it fairly thinly
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly grease a non-stick frying pan with the oil and wipe any excess with kitchen paper. 
                    Place over a medium–high heat, then add a ladleful of the batter and swirl to coat the base of the pain fairly thinly, 
                    like a crêpe. Cook for 3–4 minutes until the top is set and the bottom is very lightly golden. Remove from the pan and place on a plate. 
                    Spoon some of the filling down the centre and fold over. 
                    Repeat with the remaining batter and filling until there are eight filled dosas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To make the chutney, blitz the coriander, mint, sugar and coconut yoghurt with some pepper in a food processor or blender until well blended. 
                    Add the lime juice just before serving. Serve the filled dosas with the chutney.
                </li>
            </ol>
