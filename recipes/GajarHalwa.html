            Steps 
        </h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Heat ghee in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and stir briefly, about 3 minutes. Pour in milk and
                    increase heat; bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently, uncovered,
                    and stirring occasionally until moisture evaporates, about 1 hour. 
                </li>

                <li> Bring carrot mixture back to a boil; add sugar, raisins, cardamom, and saffron. Cook and stir until mixture has thickened, about
                    10 minutes 
                </li>
                <li> Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve warm or chill before
                    serving.
